<!-- INSTALLERS:START -->
## Installation

Every installer in this repo, with every flag and environment variable it accepts.
Installers are idempotent — re-running one updates code and preserves credentials.

### Network-devices spoke — `install_nw.sh`

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbockenstedt/nw/main/install_nw.sh \
  | sudo bash -s -- --hub lm-hub.lrbtechnologies.com
```

| Flag | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--hub URL` | Hub WebSocket URL. A bare host is fine — `lm-hub.example.com` becomes `wss://lm-hub.example.com:443`, `host:port` gets a `wss://` prefix, and an explicit `ws://`/`wss://` is left alone. Omit it to auto-discover the hub (DNS `lm-hub.<suffix>`, then mDNS `_lm-hub._tcp.local.`). |
| `--id`, `--name` | Pin the spoke id. Omitted, the id derives from the hostname, so a renamed clone reconnects under its new name. |
| `--secret` | Pre-shared spoke secret. |
| `--hub-secret` | Hub PSK for auto-approval. Without it the spoke lands in *pending approval* in the WebUI. |
| `--all-prereqs` | Accepted and ignored — kept so the hub's install-module call doesn't abort. |

**Environment overrides:** `HUB_URL` (same normalization as `--hub`), `SPOKE_ID`.
